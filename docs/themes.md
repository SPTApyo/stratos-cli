# Custom Themes

Stratos allows users to customize the visual appearance of the dashboard.

## Built-in Themes
You can switch between themes using the `--theme` flag or via the **Visual Theme** menu in the system settings.

Available themes include:
- `stratos` (Default)
- `dracula`
- `nord`
- `ayu`
- `gruvbox`
- `catppuccin`
- `solarized`
- `shades_of_purple`
- `googlecode`
- `xcode`
- `ansi`

## Creating Your Own Theme
Custom theme support is currently under development. In future versions, you will be able to define your own palette in a `user_themes.json` file.
